# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

# Example 1:

# Input: "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
# Example 2:

# Input: "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# Example 3:

    
# Input: "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
# Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

#TODO FEEDBACK
# Communication
# [11:06] ok, thatâ€™s pretty straight forward.
# [11:08] explain the idea while coding
# [11:10] jump into coding too fast without clear idea on how to solve the problem

# Problem Solving
# [11:09] use list as memory
# [11:19] no time and space complexity analysis

# Coding
# [11:08] start coding
# [11:13] finish coding but the logic is wrong
# [11:16] keep fixing the logic error
# [11:21] Abe to code out the brute force solution

# Verification
# [11:14] give hint -> take it and empty the memory
# [11:16] wrong scope to clear the memory

#TODO Inefficient code
